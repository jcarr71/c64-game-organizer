## GameBase64 Game Organizer v1.3.1

**Release Date:** January 13, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `{published_year}` placeholder to handle non-numeric years correctly
  - Years containing `?` (e.g., "198?") are now converted to use `x` (e.g., "198x")
  - This prevents Windows filesystem errors when creating folders with the `?` character
  - The `x` notation is a common convention for uncertain year digits

### Technical Details
- Added character replacement in `build_destination_path()` method
- `published_year` field now sanitizes `?` → `x` before folder creation
- Maintains readability while ensuring Windows compatibility

### Example
**Before:** "198?" would fail to create a folder on Windows
**After:** "198x" creates a valid folder path
